## 💡 Project Overview
The **Klotski Block Puzzle** is an **interactive smart puzzle game** designed to merge the fun of classic puzzles with modern sensing technology.  
Players must arrange the blocks of varying sizes into their correct positions **within a time limit** to complete the challenge.  

Each main puzzle piece contains an **RFID tag**, and when placed correctly, the **RFID reader** verifies the solution.  
This system adds an intelligent, interactive layer to traditional gameplay, making it suitable for **educational and exhibition environments**.

## ⚙️ Components Used
- **Arduino Uno** – acts as the central controller  
- **RFID Tags** – embedded inside key puzzle pieces to identify placement  
- **RFID Reader** – detects and validates the pieces’ positions  
- **Puzzle Frame and Blocks** – for the physical game setup  

---

## 💻 Software & Tools Used
- **Arduino IDE** – for programming and uploading logic to the microcontroller  
- **C/C++** – for embedded control and RFID communication
